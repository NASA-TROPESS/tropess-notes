# CrIS Suomi NPP

These products are retrieved from [CrIS Suomi NPP](intro-instruments) measurements via the [Optimal estimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_estimation) method.

## CrIS Suomi NPP reanalysis Stream - Version 1 (V1)

Data coverage time period:

- NH3, O3, CO, and PAN: December 1, 2015 to December 31, 2022
- CH4 and HDO: December 1, 2015 to May 21, 2021. 

### Summary Products

* [Ammonia (NH3)](https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/datasets/TRPSYL2NH3CRSRS_1/summary) - Vertically integrated total column 

* [Carbon monoxide (CO)](https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/datasets/TRPSYL2COCRSRS_1/summary) - Column-averaged dry air mixing ratio from the surface to the Top of the Atmosphere (TOA), also known as XCO 

* [Methane (CH4)](https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/datasets/TRPSYL2CH4CRSRS_1/summary) - Column-averaged dry air mixing ratio for the partial column between 826 hPa and the Top of the Atmosphere (TOA), also known as free tropospheric XCH4

* [Ozone (O3)](https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/datasets/TRPSYL2O3CRSRS_1/summary) - Vertically integrated total column and tropospheric column

* [Peroxyacetyl Nitrate (PAN)](https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/datasets/TRPSYL2PANCRSRS_1/summary) - Column-averaged dry air mixing ratio for the partial column between 826 hPa and 215 hPa, also known as free tropospheric XPAN 

* [Semi-heavy water vapor (HDO / Delta-D)](https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/datasets/TRPSYL2HDOCRSRS_1/summary) - Partial column between 850 and 250 hPa, expressed in parts per thousand relative to the deuterium content of ocean waters (also known as Delta-D)

> NOTICE: The CrIS instrument on the Suomi NPP spacecraft lost the Midwave IR (MW) channel on May 21, 2021. That impacted the quality of the CH4 and HDO trace gas retrievals after that date.
