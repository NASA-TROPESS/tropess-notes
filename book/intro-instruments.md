# Instruments

The following instruments are supported by the TROPESS project currently.  

## AIRS

> Launched May 4, 2002

The Atmospheric Infra-Red Sounder (AIRS) instrument was launched into Earth orbit on May 4, 2002 aboard NASA's Aqua satellite. 

The AIRS instrument is a hyper-spectral infrared atmospheric sounder. It measures a large number of wavelengths, over a two-dimensional field of view, in the infrared wavelengths.

## CrIS (JPSS-1 / NOAA-20)

> Launched November 18, 2017

This is a second instance of the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) instrument launched aboard [NOAA-20 / JPSS-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOAA-20) satellite. NOAA-20 was launched on November 18, 2017.

The [Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS)](https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/current-satellite-missions/currently-flying/joint-polar-satellite-system) includes five satellites: NOAA/NASA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite, NOAA-20 (JPSS-1), NOAA-21 (JPSS-2), and the upcoming JPSS-3 and JPSS-4 satellites.

## CrIS (Suomi NPP)

> Launched October 28, 2011

The Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) is one of the instruments currently flying on the [Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suomi_NPP) satellite which was launched on October 28, 2011. CrIS measures the infrared spectrum emitted from the top of the atmosphere. It is functionally similar to AIRS.

## OMI

> Launched July 15, 2004

The Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) flies on the NASA's Aura satellite, launched into Earth orbit on July 15, 2004.

The OMI instrument is a nadir viewing imaging spectrograph that measures the solar radiation backscattered by the Earth's atmosphere and surface over the entire wavelength range from 270 to 500 nm with a spectral resolution of about 0.5 nm.
